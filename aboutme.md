Hi, I'm Emily. Thanks for visiting my personal site. This site is for some data visualizations I've put together. They mostly cover topics in social science, specifically around urban issues, as well as some fun sports stuff. You'll also find some blog postings covering some new things I've learned and think may be helpful to others.
